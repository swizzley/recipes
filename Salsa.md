##### For Extra Hot version: don't deseed jalapeños 

 Peel the onion and cut it into four pieces, and add it to the processor.  Put the gloves on and deseed all the jalapeños after cutting off their stems.  Then add them to the food processor.  Chop off most of the stems of the cilantro then chop about half of the leaves into small fine pieces and add them to the mix, discarding the rest.  As the garlic and salt,  then add the can of tomatoes. Mix for about 30 seconds on high. Add fresh tomatos one at a time to get desired taste and heat, fewer tomatoes, the hotter it will be, and blend for a couple of seconds each time. Extra salt and or black pepper to taste.
