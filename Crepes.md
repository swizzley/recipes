# Crepes

## Ingredients:
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 2 large eggs
* 1 cup skim milk
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 2 tablespoons butter, melted

## Instructions:
Mix the Batter: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.
Heat the Pan: Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat.
Cook the Crepes: Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.
Cook Until Done: Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.

## Tips:
If the batter seems too thick, add a bit more milk or water.
Let the batter rest for about 30 minutes if you have time; it helps the crepes turn out even better.
For sweet crepes, you can add a tablespoon of sugar and a dash of vanilla extract to the batter.
